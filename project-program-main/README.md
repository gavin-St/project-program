A UW CSC Project Program project.

Think Instagram meets Google Maps with additional quality of life features, custom-tailored for the students of UWaterloo. Post reviews, study spots, hidden areas, food, anything you can think of, anywhere on campus as you connect with your peers!

Especially in a post-pandemic environment, many students may struggle to meet others and find a sense of belonging. With an increasingly online lifestyle and the hectic nature of university, we hope our app can help students to feel less alone in their daily activities, meet new people, and discover new places. We wish to collect (essentially crowd-source) and distribute information about events, clubs, resources, and locations that is otherwise hard to find and to use this information to make the university experience as enjoyable and streamlined as possible. Overall, we want to provide a clean utility application that UW students can use daily!
